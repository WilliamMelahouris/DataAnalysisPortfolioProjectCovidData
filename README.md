# Data Analysis Portfolio Project - Covid Data

This repository contains my portfolio project on Covid Data.

The data was provided from this link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths which I divided into two Excel files CovidDeaths.xlsx and CovidVaccinations.xlsx

The SQL queries I wrote for this project are contained in the Covid_Portfolio_Project_queries.sql and Covid_Portfolio_Project_queries2_vaccinations.sql files
